      <h2 style="margin: 10px;">Welcome to the Visualisation Tool for Number Theory</h2>
      <h4 style="margin: 10px;">Please note that this tool is not intended as a standalone resource, it is simply a 
        teaching aid.</h4>
      <p class="intro-content">This educational tool has been developed for students and teachers of introductory
        Number Theory to act as a plentiful source of examples with visual representations. The repeated exposure
        to a variety of similarities and differences between concrete examples aims to facilitate the formation of
        concepts with visual modes of organisation.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        To use this tool, take your time progressing through each screen and play around with numerous combinations
        of values for the variables you are presented with by changing the slider positions. All elements for you to
        control are on the left-hand side of your screen, and you will see the effect of your changes on the right. 
        The three buttons underneath the sliders also affect the state of the animation:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li><p class="intro-content"><span><input type="button" class="Render" value="Step" id="nxtBtn" name="nxtBtn">
        </span>This button will show incremental progress through the whole animation with each click. This is to 
        give you the time to see the changes between each step.</p></li>
        <li><p class="intro-content"><span><input type="button" class="Play" value="Play" id="playBtn" name="playBtn">
        </span>This button will play the full animation from the current state. This is to show you the whole pattern
        yielded by the group size and generator element you have selected. Note: this button can be pressed after
        stepping through a few increments with the button above.</p></li>
        <li><p class="intro-content"><span><input type="button" class="Reset" value="Reset" id="Reset" name="Reset">
        </span>This button allows you to clear any animation progress even before it has finished playing. Note 
        that this can also be done by changing the size of the group with the top slider.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="intro-content">Each screen is designed to build directly upon what you have seen in the previous one.
        The visualisations you will see depict the following concepts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="intro-content"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Screen 1: </span>Modular arithmetic under addition,
          generators, </li>
      </ul>
